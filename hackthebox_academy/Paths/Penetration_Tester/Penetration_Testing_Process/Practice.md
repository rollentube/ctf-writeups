# Practice
All the theories in the world will be of no use to us if we cannot transfer them into practice and apply our knowledge to real-world, hands-on situations. Putting the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) we have covered in the Penetration Tester path into use frequently is the best thing we could do to keep our skills sharp and ensure that when it comes time to put them to work in a customers environment, we are sure of ourselves and the potential impact our actions may have.

We also need excellent written and verbal communication skills to be effective penetration testers. This includes seemingly minor things like being able to write a clear and professional email and present and defend our work during a client meeting and through a professional report.

Another essential part is documentation and strong reporting skills. If our presentation is sloppy and the report is difficult to follow or does not go in-depth on vulnerability reproduction steps and give clear remediation recommendations, or the executive summary is poorly written, our hard work will not be well-received.

## Practicing Steps
The following paragraphs show a possible way to train and practice your skills with the resources of HTB (Modules, Machines, Labs). Of course, these are only recommendations, which are not directly relevant for this module. For this reason I will not summarize them here.
