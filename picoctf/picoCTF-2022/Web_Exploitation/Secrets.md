# Secrets (Medium)
We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag?

The website is running here.

## Solution
If we inspect the source of the website, we found this link:
```html
    <link href="secret/assets/index.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

Accessing the folder `/secret` shows a picture. Inspecting the source reveals this link:
```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="hidden/file.css" />
```

Heading to `/secret/hidden` and check the source again, shows this link:
```html
    <link href="superhidden/login.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

And finally under `/secret/hidden/superhidden`, we find the flag:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="mycss.css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Finally. You found me. But can you see me</h1>
    <h3 class="flag">picoCTF{succ3ss_@h3n1c@10n_790d2615}</h3>
  </body>
</html>
```
