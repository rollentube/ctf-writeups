# Vulnerability Assessment
During the vulnerability assessment phase, we examine and analyze the information gathered during the information gathering phase. The vulnerability assessment phase is an analytical process based on the findings.

An analysis is a detailed examination of an event or process, describing its origin and impact, that with the help of certain precautions and actions, can be triggered to support or prevent future occurrences.

## Types of analysis
### Descriptive analysis
* backward looking
* describes a data set based on individual characteristics
* helps to detect possible errors in data collection

### Diagnostic analysis
* backward looking
* clarifies conditions causes, effect and interactions
* correlations and interpretation
* find reasons for events

### Predictive analysis
* predictive model for future probabilities
* identify trends, detect deviations, predict future occurendes

### Prescriptive analysis
* actions to take to eliminate or prevent a future problem

### Example
Found open TCP port 2121 with nmap:
* TCP
* no standard port
* 21 could be FTP
* -> connect with Netcat or FTP to prove
* -> connection took longer (~15s) (probably configured)
* -> configure nmap to 15s or 20s timeout and scan again

## Vulnerability Research and Analysis
In Vulnerability Research we look for known vulnerabilities, exploits, and security holes that have already been discovered and reported. Therefore, if we have identified a version of a service or application through information gathering and found a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), it is very likely that this vulnerability is still present.

Sources vulnerabilities:
* CVEdetails
* Exploit DB
* SecurityFocus
* Packet Storm Security
* NIST
* Vulners

Diagnose a found vulnerability to determine what is causing it (Diagnostic + Predictive).

## Assessment of Possible Attack Vectors
Analyze historical information and combine with current information (part of Predictive Analysis). For example to avoid alerts, we should mirror the target system as precisely as possible and look for vulnerabilities in the local system.

## The Return
If we are unable to detect any vulnerabilities, we will return to the Information Gathering stage and look for more in-depth information. The Information Gathering and the Vulnerability Assessment stages often overlap, resulting in a back and forth movement between them.

## Questions
What type of analysis can be used to predict future probabilities?

Predictive
