# Local Authority (Easy)
Can you get the flag?

Go to this website and see what you can discover.

## Solution
The website shows a login form. If we enter some wrong credentials, we can see in the HTTP traffic or in the source code of the site, that there is a file called `/secure.js`, which is responsible for checking the username and password:
```js
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}
```

If we log into the site with these credentials, we get the flag:
```
picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_a8788e61}
```
