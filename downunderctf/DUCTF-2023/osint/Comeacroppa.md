# Comeacroppa (easy)
I was sorting through my photo album and I cannot seem to place this picture. Can you let me know what suburb this is in?

## Solution
We can throw this picture aswell into Google Lens and scroll a bit through the pictures until we find one that looks like the main building in this picture.

Pretty fast we found the 'Scotch Pie House' at '63 Main Street, Maldon' (https://tours.maldonmuseum.com.au/index.php/mobile/walks/9#site.47).

So our flag is: `DUCTF{Maldon}`
