# useless
There's an interesting script in the user's home directory
The work computer is running SSH. We've been given a script which performs some basic calculations, explore the script and find a flag. (100 Points)

## Solution
Inspecting the script doesnt bring much information. Just a simple calculator. But there is one hint. If the parameters arent correct the info "Read the manual" is given out. So maybe there is a man page for this script. Check it out an find the flag in there.

     useless, -- This is a simple calculator script

SYNOPSIS
     useless, [add sub mul div] number1 number2

DESCRIPTION
     Use the useless, macro to make simple calulations like addition,subtraction, multiplication and division.

Examples
     ./useless add 1 2
       This will add 1 and 2 and return 3

     ./useless mul 2 3
       This will return 6 as a product of 2 and 3

     ./useless div 6 3
       This will return 2 as a quotient of 6 and 3

     ./useless sub 6 5
       This will return 1 as a remainder of substraction of 5 from 6
