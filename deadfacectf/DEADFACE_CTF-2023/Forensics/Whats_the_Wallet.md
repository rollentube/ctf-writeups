You have been tasked with finding the Bitcoin wallet address from the provided sample so that it can be reported to the authorities.

## Solution
In the source code we find the following function:
```php
function Store-BtcWalletAddress {
    `$global:BtcWalletAddress = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes('bjMzaGE1bm96aXhlNnJyZzcxa2d3eWlubWt1c3gy'))
}
```

The string `bjMzaGE1bm96aXhlNnJyZzcxa2d3eWlubWt1c3gy` is Base64 encoded. If we decode it we get the wallet address:
```
$ echo 'bjMzaGE1bm96aXhlNnJyZzcxa2d3eWlubWt1c3gy' | base64 -d
n33ha5nozixe6rrg71kgwyinmkusx2
```

So the flag is `flag{n33ha5nozixe6rrg71kgwyinmkusx2}`.
