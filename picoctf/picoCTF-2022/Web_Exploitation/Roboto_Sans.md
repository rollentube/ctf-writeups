# Roboto Sans (Medium)
The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.

Check this out.

## Solution
If we inspect the `/robots.txt`, we get the following content:
```
User-agent *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg
Disallow: /wp-admin/
```

Trying to base64 decode the strings, reveals the following:
```
$ echo "anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==" | base64 -d
js/myfile.txt
```

Accessing the file `/js/myfile.txt`, gives us the flag:
```
$ curl http://saturn.picoctf.net:58124/js/myfile.txt
picoCTF{Who_D03sN7_L1k5_90B0T5_718c9043}
$
```
