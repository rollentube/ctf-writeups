## Data
flag.c

## Solution
The program checks if there is an integer overflow from the user input after add up the two digits. A normal 32 bit integer can present the numbers -2147483648 to 2147483647 since the first bit is for the sign.

We can also check those limits in C
```c
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
        printf("%d\n", INT_MAX);
        printf("%d\n", INT_MIN);
        return 0;
}
```

```
[root@picoctf two-sum]$ ./int-max
2147483647
-2147483648
[root@picoctf two-sum]$
```

So adding 1 to the upper limit will cause an overflow. The function 'addIntOvf' of the program will check for this and return the flag if the overflow is the case.
```c
static int addIntOvf(int result, int a, int b) {
    result = a + b;
    if(a > 0 && b > 0 && result < 0)
        return -1;
    if(a < 0 && b < 0 && result > 0)
        return -1;
    return 0;
}
```

To sum up, with the following input we get the flag:
```
[root@picoctf Binary_Exploitation]$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 60032
n1 > n1 + n2 OR n2 > n1 + n2
What two positive numbers can make this possible:
2147483647 1
You entered 2147483647 and 1
You have an integer overflow
YOUR FLAG IS: picoCTF{Tw0_Sum_Integer_Bu773R_0v3rfl0w_fe14e9e9}
