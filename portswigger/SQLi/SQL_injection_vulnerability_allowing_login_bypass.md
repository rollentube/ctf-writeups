# Lab: SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the 'administrator' user.

## Solution
The website shows an online shop where you can login. From the description we know, that there is an user called 'administrator' and that the login gives an oppotunity for an SQLi. So for the login we can try the following
```
Username: administrator' --
Password: password
```

This will probably create a SQL query like this
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' -- ' AND password = 'password'
```

With the apostrophe and the double dash we comment out the password check in the query and login just with the matched user.

The login was successfull and the challenge is solved.
