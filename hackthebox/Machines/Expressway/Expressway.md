According to the [Streaming / Writeups / Walkthrough Guidelines](https://help.hackthebox.com/en/articles/5188925-streaming-writeups-walkthrough-guidelines) by HackTheBox, I can release writeups only for retired machines. As long as the machine is still active, I will only show the [room badge](https://labs.hackthebox.com/achievement/machine/1390366/736)).
