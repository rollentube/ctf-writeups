# Post-Exploitation
Let's assume we successfully exploited the target system during the Exploitation stage. As with the Exploitation stage, we must again consider whether or not to utilize Evasive Testing in the Post-Exploitation stage. We are already on the system in the post-exploitation phase, making it much more difficult to avoid an alert. The Post-Exploitation stage aims to obtain sensitive and security-relevant information from a local perspective and business-relevant information that, in most cases, requires higher privileges than a standard user. This stage includes the following components:

## Evasive Testing
Any change or commands could trigger an alarm in the monitoring. This could result in a kick out of the network, threat hunting or loosing access to a host or user account and means that we failed the penetration test in some way. But we can also confirm that the detection works, which can also be part of the test.

Evasive testing is divided into three different categories:
* Evasive
* Hybrid Evasive
* Non-Evasive

## Information Gathering
Since we have gained a new perspective on the system and the network of our target system in the Exploitation stage, we have to go through the Information Gathering and Vulnerability Assessment stages again for the new environment.

## Pillaging
Pillaging is the stage where we examine the role of the host in the corporate network. We analyze the network configurations, including but not limited to:
* Interfaces
* Routing	DNS
* ARP
* Services
* VPN
* IP Subnets
* Shares
* Network Traffic

For example we could also find out if: 
* alternative subdomains exist
* multiple network interfaces exist
* there are other hosts with which this system communicates
* admins are connecting to other hosts from it
* we can potentially reuse credentials or steal an SSH key

During the pillaging stage, we will also hunt for sensitive data such as passwords on shares, local machines, in scripts, configuration files, password vaults, documents (Excel, Word, .txt files, etc.), and even email.

Our main goals with pillaging are to show the impact of successful exploitation and, if we have not yet reached the goal of the assessment, to find additional data such as passwords that can be inputs to other stages such as lateral movement.

## Persistence
This step is essential and often used as the first step before the Information Gathering and Pillaging stages. The goal is to maintaining access to the exploited host, so we can still access if the connection is interrupted.

## Vulnerability Assessment
With the new found information, we can use it to repeat the Vulnerability Assessment stage from the new perspective. Again we analyze the information and prioritize it accordingly. Mostly goal is to escalate our privileges.

## Privilege Escalation
Getting the highest possible privileges on the system or domain is often crucial and represents a critical moment. We want to get the privileges of the root (on Linux-based systems) or the domain administrator/local administrator/SYSTEM (on Windows-based systems).

But we can also obtain stored credentials during the information gathering stage. This could also lead to higher privileges.

## Data Exfiltration
Some clients will want to check whether it is possible to exfiltrate considerable personal information and customer data. This means we try to transfer this information from the target system to our own. Security systems such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) help detect and prevent data exfiltration. It can often be enough to create some bogus data (such as fake credit card numbers or social security numbers) and exfiltrate it to our system.

Companies must adhere to data security regulations and frameworks (NIST, ISO, etc.) depending on the type of data involved. For this reason it is important how we handle the found data and information. Like already said, we can also simulate to exfiltrate data as a proof of concept.
