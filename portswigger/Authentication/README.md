# Authentication vulnerabilities
Conceptually at least, authentication vulnerabilities are some of the simplest issues to understand. However, they can be among the most critical due to the obvious relationship between authentication and security. As well as potentially allowing attackers direct access to sensitive data and functionality, they also expose additional attack surface for further exploits.
