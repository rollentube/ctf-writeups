Can you make sense of this file? (100 Points)

## Files
- enc\_flag

## Solution
Seems like Base encoded content. CyberChef to decrypt. Still Base encoded. Base64 has the only "normal" looking output. Used Base64 several times until the flag shows up: 

picoCTF{base64\_n3st3d\_dic0d!n8\_d0wnl04d3d\_c0ac1752}
