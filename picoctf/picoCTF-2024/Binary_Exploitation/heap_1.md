# heap 1 (100 points)
Can you control your overflow?

## Data

* chall.c

## Solution
Like already explained in [heap 0](./heap_0.md), the code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The only difference is that we have to control the value of the overidden variable in this challenge. To so we can just try out how many bytes we need to read the variable `safe_var`:
```
Welcome to heap1!
I put my data on the heap so it should be safe from any tampering.
Since my data isn't on the stack I'll even let you write whatever info you want to the heap, I already took care of using malloc for you.

Heap State:
+-------------+----------------+
[*] Address   ->   Heap Data
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x5dda3c44b6b0  ->   pico
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x5dda3c44b6d0  ->   bico
+-------------+----------------+

1. Print Heap:          (print the current state of the heap)
2. Write to buffer:     (write to your own personal block of data on the heap)
3. Print safe_var:      (I'll even let you look at my variable on the heap, I'm confident it can't be modified)
4. Print Flag:          (Try to print the flag, good luck)
5. Exit
