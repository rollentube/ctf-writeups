# Penetration Testing Process
The module explains the entire penetration test process in detail and highlights the essential components with examples. Because a penetration test can potentially damage some systems, we must prepare ourselves and our customers. This includes creating and preparing a contract with the customer and covering what to look for and what aspects to consider.

Some of the sections treat the same toppic, but in different depth. I will concentrate on the most important points and note them down. So some modules will be merged together in a single file. Other will be seperated.

Also I won't sum up everything. If the paragraphs are on point and short enough, I will copy them. So all the credits belongs to HTB Academy. This applies for the pictures aswell.

If there are solutions for the sections, I will discuss them.
