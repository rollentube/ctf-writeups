## Solution
On the picture we find a phone number on a sign:

If we look up this number for example with https://www.usphonebook.com/ we find the following entry:
![Phonebook](./images/nice_vacation_phonebook.png)

I tried both addresses  `Bar Nunn, WY` and `Casper, WY`. The second was the right one. The flag is `flag{Casper, WY}`
