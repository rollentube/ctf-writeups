Reasons for using POST instead of GET:
    Very long arguments that exceed the maximum URL length (generally somewhere around 2000 characters depending on the browser and web server).
    Non-text parameters such as files, e.g., when uploading something to a cloud drive.
    Passwords or other sensitive data. You don't want your password to appear as plaintext in your address bar. Just imagine having someone look over your shoulder or sending someone a link to a video you found online and accidentally sending them your password as well.


Breakpoints in ZAP (interrupt redirect):
 You need to access the security gate and then actively intercept the second request and modify it before it reaches the webserver. In order to do that, you have to enable "Set breakpoint on all requests and responses" in ZAP. That's that little green circle right in the middle of the menu bar at the top.

Once you activate that, ZAP will break and freeze the HTTP conversation every time your browser makes a request or the web server sends a response. You can step through the conversation with the other buttons next to the previous one, similar to how you would use a debugger.

When you trigger a breakpoint in ZAP, you can manipulate the request or response before it reaches the web server or your browser.
