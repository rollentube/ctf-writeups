## Solution
We don't have any GPS information in the picture, but it is clearly the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. You can also find this out with Google Lens. But those are not the answers. We need the location from where the picture is made from.

If we compare the picture with Google Maps, we can see that it is made from the north side of the bridge. The only view point here that matche the agle of the picture is the Vista Point. We can also find this if scroll through the results of Google Lens.

So our flag is: `DUCTF{Vista_Point}`
