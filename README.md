# CTF writeups
This is my personal collection of CTF writeups from different platforms and competitions. Feel free to read and comment. Maybe they can help you.

Some older writeups are just some "notes" I took, so they are maybe not really transparent. Also, some older ones are written in German. Maybe I will rework them sometimes.

## Structure
There is one folder for each platform/competition I took part. In there you will find subfolders or the writeups itself named by the challenge name. Also, you will find some information, files and scripts from the challenges.

## Disclaimer
I am not a professional, I am just having fun learning new stuff and want to share my writeups. Also, this repo is a centralized kinda CTF KDB and timeline for me.
