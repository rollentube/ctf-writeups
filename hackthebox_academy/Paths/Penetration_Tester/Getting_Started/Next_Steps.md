# Next Steps
Now that we have finished this module, we should be ready to start working on our next steps on Hack The Box and build our penetration testings skills and information security portfolio. Let us discuss some of the following steps we can follow.

Like in the section before, this one is also related to the HTB platforms. I will sum it up.

## Boxes & Challenges
### Root a Retired Easy Box
Complete retired Easy rated boxes with the help of public walkthroughs and videos.

### Complete a Retired Medium Box
If a few Easy boxes were done, head over to Medium boxes.

### Root Our First Live Box
If we have completed a 5-10 Easy/Medium boxes we can try to beat an easy live machine. There are not writeups for live machines, so it could be a bit harder.

If one is completed, move on to others and try higher difficulties.

## Keep Learning
If we face new topics we can't solve it could be useful to go further through Academy Modules to cover all relevant aspects in penetration testing.

## Giving Back
### Answer Questions
Answer questions to boxes and challenges in the forum or on Discord.

### Share a Retired Box Walkthrough
If the machines we solved are retired, we should write a clean writeup and publish it. This is a good training for our documentation skills.
