# Penetration Tester Path
This module is an introduction to the Penetration Tester Job Role Path and a general introduction to Penetration Tests and each of the phases that we cover in-depth throughout the modules. We recommend starting the path with this module and referring to it periodically as you complete other modules to see how each topic area fits in the bigger picture of the penetration testing process. This module is also a great starting point for anyone new to HTB Academy or the industry.
