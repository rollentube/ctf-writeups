Do you know how to use the web inspector?

Start searching [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:57534/) to find the flag

## Solution
We find a pretty weird looking website. The description says that we have to inspect it for the flag, but on the starting page there is nothing interesting.

If we head over to the `ABOUT` page we can find a promising section:
```html
  <section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZGYwZGE3Mjd9">
   <h1>
    Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there
   </h1>
   <!-- .about-container -->
  </section>
```

The value of `notify_true` looks like Base64 and should be worth a try:
```
$ echo "cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfZGYwZGE3Mjd9" | base64 --decode
picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_df0da727}$
```

And we found our flag!
