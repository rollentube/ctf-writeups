# format string 0 (50 points)
Can you use your knowledge of format strings to make the customers happy?

Connect with the challenge instance here: `nc mimas.picoctf.net 60125`

## Data
* format-string-0
* format-string-0.c

## Solution
The program implements a segmentation fault handler:
```c
void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
    printf("\n%s\n", flag);
    fflush(stdout);
    exit(1);
}
```

So if we can cause a segmentation fault, the flag will be printed. The input buffer has a 32 byte size:
```c
#define BUFSIZE 32

[...]

    char choice1[BUFSIZE];
    scanf("%s", choice1);
```

So if we enter an input that is widely over this size, we should get a segmentation vault:
```
$ nc mimas.picoctf.net 60125
