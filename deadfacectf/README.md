# DEADFACE CTF
Every October, Cyber Hacktics organizes a Capture-the-Flag event in support of Cyber Security Awareness Month. Competitors play on teams of up to four players and must solve challenges relating to various cybersecurity and computer science disciplines.

DEADFACE CTF is a contextual, story-driven CTF. What does that mean? It means that all of the challenges revolve around a central storyline. Information gathered from one challenge may be necessary to solve future challenges. It is important to treat this CTF like an investigation - if you find something on a DEADFACE member, it's important to write it down! It may be useful later on down the road.
