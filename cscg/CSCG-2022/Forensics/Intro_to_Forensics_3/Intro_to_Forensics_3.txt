Bless Hex Editor

- take a look hexdump -C
- seems like png file, with wrong header
- check wiki for correct header
- swap IEND with IHDR
- upload file to online analyser
- one IDAT chunk seems to be broken
  - correct the 4 size bytes to 500.000 (like the other chunks)
- all chunks have incorrect CRC
  - fixing them was not the solution
- the "wrong" crc seems to be numerated (0b, 0a, 09, 08, 07, ..., 01)
  - change the order of those chunks to 01, 02, ..., 0b
  - first 4 bytes are "00 07 A1 20" (size 500.000 bytes) and the last is the crc, for example "00 00 00 01"
  - the ...0b chunk has not 500.000 bytes size, so probably it should be the last
  - rearrange the order with the Bless Hex Editor
  - correct the CRC like the online analyser has shown
-> correct png is shown with the flag
(chunks has to be reversed, size fixed of one chunk, crc corrected)

Flag:
