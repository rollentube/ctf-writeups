# Exploitation
During the Exploitation stage, we look for ways that these weaknesses can be adapted to our use case to obtain the desired role (i.e., a foothold, escalated privileges, etc.). If we want to get a reverse shell, we need to modify the PoC to execute the code, so the target system connects back to us over (ideally) an encrypted connection to an IP address we specify. Therefore, the preparation of an exploit is mainly part of the Exploitation stage.

So Exploitation and Proof-of-Concept are closely connected.

If all exploitations were done and documented successfully, we move on to the post-exploitation and lateral movement stages.

## Prioritization of Possible Attacks
Vulnerabilities we found in the Vulnerability Assessment stage, should be priorized before the Exploitation according to the following factors:
* Probability of Success (see [CVSS Scoring](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) and [NVD calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator))
* Complexity (experience, time, effort and research of exploiting)
* Probability of Damage (avoiding damage to the target systems)

### Example
| Factor                    | Points  | Remote File Inclusion | Buffer Overflow |
| ------------------------- | ------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| 1. Probability of Success | 10      | 10                    | 8               |
| 2. Complexity - Easy      | 5       | 4                     | 0               |
| 3. Complexity - Medium    | 3       | 0                     | 3               |
| 4. Complexity - Hard      | 1	      | 0	                  | 0               |
| 5. Probability of Damage  | -5      | 0                     | -5              |
| Summary                   | max. 15 | 14                    | 6               |

-> Prefer the remote file inclusion

## Preparation for the Attack
If we can't find a high-quality, known working PoC, we have to reconstruct the exploit locally on a mirror of the target host and try to figure out what adaptions has to be made. If the changed exploit works and doesn't create any damage on the test system, we can use it for the real target.

If ever in doubt before running an attack, it's always best to check with our client or communicate with our team lead.
