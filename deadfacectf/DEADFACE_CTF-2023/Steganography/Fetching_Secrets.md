## Solution
Searching for stego in the forum brings us to this [thread](https://ghosttown.deadface.io/t/trying-out-some-stego/95). In here was the picture posted and the user chat about the kind of dog and naming:
![Thread](./images/fetching_secrets_thread.png)

So maybe there is something hidden in the file that can be extracted with one of the words `shepherd`, `Kira`, `kira`, `killer`.

Gave it a try and got the flag:
```
$ steghide extract -sf cyberdog.jpg -p kira -xf extracted
wrote extracted data to "extracted".
```
