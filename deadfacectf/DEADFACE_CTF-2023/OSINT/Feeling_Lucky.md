It seems DEADFACE was able to track Ajejandro's movements again. They shared this photo they took from Alejandro. Knowing this location might help us intercept the DEADFACE member who's looking for Alejandro.

Submit flag as `flag{City, state code, Zip Code}`. Example: `flag{Allison Park, PA, 15101}`.

## Solution
I searched with Google Lens for this picture. Especially for the part of the Lucky market. And in the result I noticed a picture that could match:

Opening the site shows the following address:
![Flag](./images/feeling_lucky_flag.png)

Gave it a try and it was correct. The flag is: `flag{West Valley City, UT, 84119}`
