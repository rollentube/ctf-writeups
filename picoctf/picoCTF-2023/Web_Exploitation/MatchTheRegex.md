# MatchTheRegex
How about trying to match a regular expression (100 Points)

## Solution
The challenge is telling us about regex. Opening the site there is only a little input prompt. Typing something in reveals 'wrong match! Try again!'. So probably we have to match the flag via regex.

The program code has also some hint `// ^p.....F!?`

Typing in a simple regex to match the characteristics of the pico flag gives the flag `picoCTF{.*}`. The flag is: picoCTF{succ3ssfully\_matchtheregex\_f89ea585}
