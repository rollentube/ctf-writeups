The website shows a form to search for cookie types:

![Website](./images/Cookies_0.png)

If we enter the given one _snickerdoodle_, we get a valid response:

![Valid cookie](./images/Cookies_1.png)

We can inspect the HTTP traffic and see that the cookie is accessed via `/check` with the cookie HTTP header:

![HTTP](./images/Cookies_2.png)

If we iterate through the numbers, we get valid responses for different cookies. We can just set up an Intruder for this value and check the different responses. There was one with a different length. This one contained the flag:
