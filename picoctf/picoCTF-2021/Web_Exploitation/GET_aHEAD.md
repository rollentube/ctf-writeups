![Website](./images/GET_aHEAD_0.png)

If we inspect the source code or the HTTP traffic, we can see, that _Red_ creates a GET and _Blue_ a POST request. Depending on the request, the action is choosen. So we can just try more [request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods), we can find a good catch with the method HEAD:
