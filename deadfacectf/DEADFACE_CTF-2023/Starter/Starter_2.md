We need your help! DEADFACE has been wreaking havoc on several companies and individuals. Many of us have joined together to form **Turbo Tactical**, an organization of cybersecurity and infosec professionals and enthusiasts to help out DEADFACE's victims.

While performing some basic reconnaissance, we found a public Discourse forum called Ghost Town that DEADFACE uses to communicate with each other. We managed to get an insider to open the forum up to non-authenticated users. Use Ghost Town as a resource to find out what DEADFACE is up to and how they managed to execute their attacks.

There is a post titled "Where to even get started". Submit the flag as the username of the user that started the post and the date the post was made in this format: `flag{username_MMDD}`.

Example: `flag{hackyboi_0615}`

## Solution
At the top right is a search bottom. Here we can search for the title. The username ist `daem0n` and the thread was started `May 18`. So the flag is `flag{daem0n_0518}`
