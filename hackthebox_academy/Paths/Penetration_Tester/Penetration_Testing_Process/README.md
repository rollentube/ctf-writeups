# Penetration Testing Process
Some of the sections treat the same toppic, but in different depth. I will concentrate on the most important points and note them down. So some modules will be merged together in a single file. Other will be seperated.

Also I won't sum up everything. If the paragraphs are on point and short enough, I will copy them. So all the credits belongs to HTB Academy. This applies for the pictures aswell.

If there are solutions for the sections, I will discuss them.
